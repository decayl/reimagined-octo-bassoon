<p>In reflection of my contribution to the sports festival, I took the initiative to construct the foundation of our spirited cheers and yells. Collaborating closely with my fellow St. Elizabeth Student leaders, we worked together to craft energetic chants that would resonate with our section. Leveraging the collective creativity and enthusiasm of the team, I not only devised the cheers but also played a crucial role in disseminating and teaching them to the entire section.
